# Circuit Analysis Calculator Application
  
## About Us

This calculator was created by Cody Carter and Rohan Patel, two computer engineering students with a shared goal: to develop an all-in-one application that simplifies and solves nodal analysis equations using a graphical interface—a lightweight and accessible alternative to MATLAB.

Together we built a working backend and intuitive, user-friendly interface to work on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. We then split developent for mobile, where 
Rohan focused on the Android version using Kotlin, while Cody focused on iOS using Swift.

We built this tool to help students and engineers quickly solve nodal or mesh analysis problems.

# Calculator Background

### *The Goal:*
For this project, we wanted to create an all-in-one application to simplify and solve nodal analysis linear equations without using MATLAB code. Since it can take time to get MATLAB open, write your program, and execute it, we decided to make an easy to use calculator that can be open at any time while doing circuit analysis problems. 

### *How Nodal Analysis Is Calculated:*
Nodal analysis is a handy circuit analysis technique that allows you to solve unknown currents and voltages.

Step 1: Locate node or nodes.

![Step 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82bac9aa-aa20-44e0-99bb-f08987520698)

Step 2: Pick current directions.

Step 3. Create KVL equations for each branch of the node in terms of Ohms law.

![equations](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a06c1643-5092-4bbc-b3e3-1b3d14302615)

Step 4: Here is where our calculator application comes in handy. Normally, to solve for I1 and I2, you would use solving techniques like Cramers Rule to input the KVL equations into a matrix and solve for I1 and I2. For proof of concept, the steps will be shown in calculation.

As you can see, while this is a simple example, it still took a bit of calculation by hand. Especially with three or four unknowns it becomes a lot easier to make errors.

### How Our Circuit Analyzer Calculates 
1. Using the Python library NumPy, users can enter their constants of their KCL equations into the matrix. Where you enter your constants in this format. Due to language differences, an equivalent implementation to NumPy is used for compatibility with iOS and Android versions.

2. The linear system will then be solved using a technique like Cramers Rule from the last example.
  
3. A gui was designed for a modern and lightweight look and feel. When calculated, your equations will be displayed so you can check your work, and the currents in amps and polar form for AC analysis.
